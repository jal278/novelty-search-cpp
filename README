This distribution uses a modified version of the rtNEAT software
package from http://nn.cs.ucf.edu/keyword?rtneat
rtNEAT includes its own software license, which is included in this release.
However, because Novelty Search C++ does not utilize the real-time component
of rtNEAT, it or any extension of it is not covered under the rtNEAT license.  
However, if you utilize the modified rtNEAT code to create a real-time 
application, then the rtNEAT license would apply to your code.

2. USAGE and SUPPORT
---------------------

We hope that this software will be a useful starting point for your
own explorations with novelty search. The software is
provided as is, however, we will do our best to maintain it and accommodate
suggestions. If you want to be notified of future releases of the
software or have questions, comments, bug reports or suggestions, send
email to jlehman@eecs.ucf.edu

Alternatively, you may post your questions on the NEAT Users Group at :
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/.

The following explains how to use Novelty Search C++. For information 
on compiling Novelty Search C++, please see the section on compiling below.

Intro
------

Novelty search is a new perspective on evolutionary computation
and search; instead of following a gradient towards a predetermined
objective, novelty search follows gradients towards *any* novel 
behavior. It is motivated by the fact that objective functions may
 sometimes hinder objectives from being reached. 

A complete explanation of novelty search is available here:

The version of Novelty Search C++ distributed in this package executed
the experiments in the above paper.

Usage Instructions
---------------------------

The only experiment packaged with this release is the maze navigation
experiment from the above publication. To run an experiment,
invoke the program as follows:

./rtneat maze.ne medium_maze.txt

Then select from either using fitness-based search or novelty-based search.
The program will terminate when a solution is found, or 500,000 evaluations
have elapsed. You can also substitute hard_maze.txt for medium_maze.txt to 
test Novelty Search C++ on the hard maze (see the above paper for more 
details).

Collecting Results
---------------------------

If a run is successful, the program will write out which individual solved
the maze and terminate. Regardless upon whether the run is successful or not,
several files will be created when the run terminates:

runresults.dat - Contains the value of the archive threshold and how many 
individuals were added in each generation

rtarchive.dat - Contains all the individuals in the archive

rtgen_final - Contains all the individuals in the population at the time when
the run ended.

record.dat - Contains a record of each individual created. The first column
contains the fitness of each individual, the second and third columns 
indicate the x and y coordinates of each individual at the end of its 
evaluation within the maze. 

Creating your own Experiments
-----------------------------

Noveltyexp.cpp provides documented code that implements novelty search in the
maze domain. It is a good starting point for your own experiments. The functions
maze_novelty_realtime and maze_novelty_realtime_loop are good templates to
copy and use for implementing another experiment. They are called from
neatmain.cpp.

Noveltyset.h and noveltyset.cpp provide the code responsible for the novelty
archive and novelty score calculations.

Maze.h is the implementation of the maze navigation domain used in the 
experiments from the publication above.

3. COMPILING
--------------

The provided makefile should work under most linux/unix environments.
There are no external dependencies. Simply type make in the Novelty
Search C++ directory, and the rtneat executable will be created.
